BREADTH, FREENESS, <span class="GutSmall">AND</span> YET
EXCLUSIVENESS OF THE GOSPEL.<br />
<span class="smcap">John iii</span>. 16.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject has, I presume, been
chosen for our discussion, in order to meet the aspersions of
those who claim for their own system the merit of breadth,
comprehensiveness, and large-heartedness, while they speak of our
Gospel as the narrow-minded theology of a body of men whose
contracted intellects are so cramped and stunted that they are
unable to take in the broad views of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; Such persons consider themselves broad, and us
narrow; and their teaching to be characterized by largeness, ours
by narrowness; theirs by generosity, ours by bigotry; theirs by
comprehensive philanthropy, ours by an exclusive interest in a
small section of the human family.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Now there
is something very noble in broad, large, and comprehensive views
of the dealings and character of God, and something, on the other
hand, exceedingly repulsive in any disposition to contract
God&rsquo;s message, or to half close the door which God has
opened wide for the world.&nbsp; And, more than that, there is
something so grand in the magnificence of creation, that we
cannot be surprised if our judgment naturally decides in favour
of that which claims to be the broader view of the religious
government of God.&nbsp; We fully acknowledge therefore the
attractiveness and persuasiveness of breadth, and are fully
prepared to admit that the broad has much more to commend it than
the narrow, and that the probability of truth lies on the side of
the broadest, the widest, the freest message.</p>
<p>But, while freely admitting that the broadest statement of the
Gospel is most probably the truest, we have yet to decide the
question, which statement is really the broadest, and on which
side is the narrowness to be found? and if this question be
fairly considered, it may possibly turn out that that which calls
itself the broad is really the narrow, and that which some men
call narrow is possessed of a breadth, and length, and depth, and
height, that can only be measured by the infinity of God.&nbsp;
It is well therefore to consider whether the Gospel, as revealed
in Scripture, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>is really broad or really narrow,&mdash;applying the
tests of breadth and fulness to the message of salvation as
proclaimed in the Gospel of the grace of God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; <i>Its breadth</i>.</p>
<p>Is there in all language, a wider, broader, fuller, and more
comprehensive statement, than is found in the words of our
blessed Redeemer,&mdash;&ldquo;God so loved the world, that He
gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him
should not perish, but have everlasting life&rdquo;?&nbsp; It
describes a Divine and eternal love, originating a salvation
unmerited, unlooked for, and as far above all human thoughts as
heaven is above the earth.&nbsp; It declares the object of it to
be the world, the whole world, and nothing short of the world;
for it is just as unreasonable to maintain that the world in this
verse means the elect, as it would be to maintain that &ldquo;the
elect of God,&rdquo; in Col. iii., means the world.&nbsp; It
proclaims the most magnificent possible offer as the result of
it.&nbsp; God forbid that we should ever cramp, fetter, or limit
it!&nbsp; It is the New Testament exposition of the Old Testament
invitation,&mdash;&ldquo;Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
the waters,&rdquo; and it is the foundation of the message heard
from heaven,&mdash;&ldquo;The Spirit and the Bride say, Come: and
let him that heareth say, Come: and let him that is athirst come:
and whosoever will, let him take the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>water of life freely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
Lord&rsquo;s words on earth are one with His words in heaven, and
both proclaim an unqualified invitation to all, without the
exclusion of an individual.&nbsp; The invitation is as broad as
the world itself, and there is no man, woman, or child under the
whole heaven, to whom God, in His unbounded mercy, has not sent
the gracious message of free and complete salvation.</p>
<p>If we look more closely at the details, we find that the glad
tidings are not limited,&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>By nationality</i>.</p>
<p>When Wilberforce pleaded in the House of Commons for the
admission of missionaries to India, it was argued that the Gospel
was not adapted to the Indian mind, and that it was not in the
nature of things that Hindoos should be converted to God.&nbsp;
So persons, laying claim to great anthropological wisdom, appear
to regard the Gospel as something never meant for the
African.&nbsp; But there is no limitation in Scripture.&nbsp;
African, Indian, American, New Zealander, are all alike included
in the message as found there.&nbsp; The Jew of old believed that
it was only for the Jews, and some English in modern times seem
to regard it as intended only for the European.&nbsp; But the
Word of God says it is for <i>all</i>; experience proves it to be
for <i>all</i>; and the comparatively recent missionary efforts
of the Church of Christ have been sufficient to prove <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>that climate
makes no difference as to faith; and, whether it be under a
tropical sun, or in an arctic frost, the knowledge of Christ is
followed up by the same results,&mdash;the same change of heart,
the same love, the same fruits of the Spirit, the same joy and
peace in believing, and the same blessed hope to fill the soul in
the dying hour.&nbsp; Our missionary spirit therefore should be
wide as the world; and those who boast of the superior broadness
of their principles, ought to lead the way in a large-hearted
effort to follow up the directions of their
Saviour:&mdash;&ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is not limited by <i>ecclesiastical order</i>.</p>
<p>God forbid that I should say one word that should appear for
one moment to make light of Christian order, for I believe it to
be a subject far too much forgotten by devoted men in the present
day.&nbsp; Evangelical zeal is considered by some to have full
license to override all authority, and break through every
regulation.&nbsp; There are many excellent, zealous, faithful,
and fervent spirits, who are contending manfully for the
inspiration of the whole of Scripture, but who appear completely
to ignore such words as those by St. Paul, in 1 Thess. v. 12,
13.&nbsp; I believe therefore, that it is one of the special
duties of the day to urge devoted Christians to investigate what
Scripture says <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>of order.&nbsp; But, however important it be, we must
still remember that the glad tidings of the Gospel are not
limited to any order or any system whatever.&nbsp; Our episcopacy
is gathered from facts recorded in Scripture, but is never
established by the authority of a command.&nbsp; We adopt it
because we believe it to be in harmony with Apostolic practice as
revealed in Scripture; but we dare not pronounce it an essential:
for it is not so pronounced in Scripture.&nbsp; There is not one
word there to lead us to suppose that episcopacy is like one
great conduit pipe, through which alone grace can flow.&nbsp; The
blessed message is not limited to any one channel.&nbsp; The Holy
Spirit is free as the winds of heaven; and it is perfectly clear
that God, in saving souls, has not tied Himself down to the
employment of any particular Church organization.&nbsp; As the
message is sent to all men, in all countries, and under all
circumstances, so also is it conveyed through all kinds of
instrumentalities;&mdash;Episcopalian and
Nonconformist,&mdash;ordained and unordained,&mdash;Churchmen,
Dissenters, Presbyterians,&mdash;Churches at home and Churches
abroad,&mdash;teachers, preachers, pastors and evangelists; for
there is a breadth in the agency as well as in the sphere of
action, and the same Lord over all, who is rich unto all that
call upon Him, is rich also unto all who labour for His Name.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>3.&nbsp;
Once more: there is no <i>doctrinal limitation</i>.</p>
<p>I presume that we are perfectly agreed as to the Scriptural
truth,&mdash;that our salvation in Christ Jesus is to be ascribed
entirely to the Father&rsquo;s electing love.&nbsp; We know that
it was not our fallen, ruined, sin-corrupted will which chose
Him, but His own boundless grace which chose us to life.&nbsp; In
other words, we know that salvation is the result of God&rsquo;s
election, and we believe in the words of our
Lord,&mdash;&ldquo;No man can come to Me except the Father which
hath sent Me draw him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we have all probably
felt, at some time or other, the difficulty of reconciling such a
fact with the free offer of life to all.&nbsp; It is not
unnatural that men should argue, that if the elect alone are
saved, to them alone must the salvation be offered.&nbsp; I am
not prepared to find any fault with the logical process which
leads to this conclusion, for I fully admit that to my own mind
the logic seems correct; but God&rsquo;s eternal counsels rise
high above all human logic, and there are deep mysteries in His
infinite mind, which we finite thinkers are utterly unable to
unravel.&nbsp; So it is in this instance.&nbsp; Our logic breaks
down, but His Word stands fast; and that Word teaches us that
God&rsquo;s election does not neutralize the free offer, any more
than the Godhead of the Lord Jesus Christ neutralized His
Manhood.&nbsp; How it is we cannot explain, any more than we can
the union of two natures in the <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>one Person of our Blessed
Saviour.&nbsp; But, thanks be to God, we find in Scripture the
universal offer side by side with electing love; so that,
accepting Scripture as we find it, we learn that election does
not narrow the breadth of the offer, or take away its
universality.&nbsp; It does not blot out the
&ldquo;whosoever&rdquo; from the words of our Saviour.&nbsp; It
does not contract the glad tidings; but it leaves the Gospel
perfectly open to every man, without qualification, without
limitation, and without the necessity of any evidence of election
to precede a trust in the Lord Jesus for pardon, life, and
immortality.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; But we must pass on to the <i>freeness</i>.&nbsp;
For there might be an offer made to every one, but yet on such
terms that no one could accept it; and so would this have been,
had God required that there should be one act of sinless
obedience on our part, as a preliminary qualification to our
being saved in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; The person who is possessed of
nothing is as little able to pay one pound as a hundred; and the
ruined man, dead in sin, is as little able to produce one act of
life as a hundred.&nbsp; So long as he is dead he can produce
nothing; for he is not only without God, but also without
strength.&nbsp; Oh, the depth of the riches of the tender
lovingkindness of our God!&nbsp; Oh, the wonders of that grace
that does not wait till the sinner <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>can produce a something, however
small that something be; but freely, and graciously, and
mercifully, and lovingly, bestows a free, full, perfect,
complete, and everlasting reconciliation on the poor ruined
sinner, even at the very time of his utter ruin!&nbsp; I do not
pretend to know all the various religious systems of the world;
but this I can most safely say,&mdash;that I never yet heard of
anything but the blessed Gospel of the grace of God, which
proclaims reconciliation to men without a claim, and at the very
time that they are without a claim.&nbsp; In every other system
the order is amendment first, and forgiveness second: but in the
Gospel the order is reversed, and we find the forgiveness first,
as a free gift, while the amendment follows, as the blessed fruit
of the Spirit in a repentant and loving heart.&nbsp; The language
of Scripture is not what any natural moralist would have
written,&mdash;&ldquo;There is forgiveness with Thee if I can but
fear Thee sufficiently:&rdquo; but God reverses the order, so
that those who cannot, for one moment, stand before Him, are
taught to say,&mdash;&ldquo;There is forgiveness with Thee that
Thou mayest be feared.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should like to know from
those who boast of the superior benevolence of their system, what
that system does for the helpless,&mdash;for the man whose soul
is paralyzed, and whose power to rise is gone, being deadened by
his sin.&nbsp; I fearlessly ask the advocate of mere natural
religion, what the <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>religion of nature can do for such an one.&nbsp; His
moral sense may teach him his duty, and his conscience may bring
him in guilty of not having fulfilled that duty; but what does
natural religion do to reinstate and restore him?&nbsp; Our
Gospel proclaims to him pardon, and our Saviour gives him life,
even at the time of the deepest ruin.&nbsp; But what does nature
do for him?&nbsp; What does conscience do to restore him?&nbsp;
It leaves him condemned, ruined, sunk, and helpless; and holds
out to him nothing better than the hope, that when he has got out
of the pit, he may find mercy through the benevolence of
God.&nbsp; If that were the Gospel, it would be glad tidings to
those only who have already recovered themselves from their
ruin.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus would be a Saviour for only such as do
not need one.&nbsp; It would be a promise of life to those only
who have already raised themselves from death; but it would be a
sentence of everlasting exclusion against all those who have
failed as often as we have done, and have had to learn from
bitter experience the sad lesson of their utter
helplessness.&nbsp; But, praised be God, the whole ransom has
been paid, the whole claim of the law satisfied, the utmost depth
of ruin fully provided for; so that now there is life in the
midst of death, and full, complete, and final reconciliation
presented to the sinner, at the very time when he is lost in his
fall.&nbsp; Did the world ever produce an offer so free? <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and was there
ever yet a religious system in the world which presented such a
salvation, on such terms, to the sinner?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; But still there is an <i>exclusiveness</i> in the
Gospel.</p>
<p>Let us however clearly understand, when we speak of
exclusiveness, that we do not mean exclusiveness in the glad
tidings, for, as already shown, these glad tidings are freely
sent to every man; but what we do mean is,&mdash;that Christ
Jesus is the only Saviour, and that &ldquo;there is none other
name under heaven, given amongst men, whereby we must be
saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do mean that God has not promised
salvation through a conscientious devotion to Buddha, or Vishnu,
or Mahommed, or reason, or the light of nature; but that God, in
giving Christ as our life, gave Him as the only Source of life,
and not as one amongst many Saviours.</p>
<p>Now this exclusiveness appears to be the necessary consequence
of the breadth and freedom of the offer; and had I had the
framing of the thesis, I should have preferred to have stated it
as &ldquo;The breadth, freeness, and <i>consequent</i>
exclusiveness of the Gospel:&rdquo; for if we consider the great
origin of the Gospel,&mdash;the eternal love of God; the
marvellous plan of the Gospel,&mdash;the sacrifice of the Son of
God; the boundless mercy of the Gospel,&mdash;as seen in the
offering such a salvation to <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>every poor sinner under heaven; and
the unutterable grace of the Gospel,&mdash;in offering it freely
to poor sinners, at the very time that those sinners are
hopelessly sunk in the ruin of their sin;&mdash;it does appear to
be an act of the deepest presumption for men to suppose that
there may be other ways through which men can be saved, other
systems through which men can be restored.&nbsp; If men could be
saved any other way, why did the Lord Jesus come? why did He
die?&nbsp; If self-denying idolatry or conscientious morality
were sufficient, why was there any Gospel at all? and why were we
not left to win our way to eternal life, by morality and
heathenism in all their varied forms?&nbsp; If the Gospel be
regarded as a Divine remedy for the sinner, then surely it must
be exclusive.&nbsp; If this be God&rsquo;s plan, then surely a
plan from God was needful, and no human plan was
sufficient.&nbsp; If it were a human plan, then I could perfectly
understand that other human plans might be equally
effectual,&mdash;or, I should rather say, equally fruitless; but
if it be really God&rsquo;s plan, then it must stand alone as the
only way of restoration to life.</p>
<p>The only possible way of meeting this view of the subject is,
by supposing that the result of our Lord&rsquo;s propitiation is
applied, without their knowledge, to those who do not believe in
His Name.&nbsp; Of course if this were God&rsquo;s plan, we
should have nothing to say, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and our simple duty would be to
accept it with thanksgiving.&nbsp; But on this point we must be
wholly dependent on God&rsquo;s own statement of His own
counsel.&nbsp; When we are studying God&rsquo;s purpose, our only
hope of arriving at truth is by simple dependence on what God has
revealed to us in His Word; and not the smallest reliance can be
placed on any conclusions which we may draw from what we think
most probable in so benevolent a God.&nbsp; Of course if men do
not believe in Scripture, as inspired by the Spirit, this
evidence fails them; but then they have nothing to assure them
that there is any Gospel at all.&nbsp; But if we admit it to be
God&rsquo;s plan, then from God we must learn its character, and
His Word alone must guide our decision.&nbsp; Now it is needless
for me to multiply passages, as I might do to almost any extent,
to show that in God&rsquo;s Word we are taught, that the
blessings of our Lord&rsquo;s work are not bestowed except
through faith in His Name.&nbsp; Whatever conclusions men may
derive from their own ideas of Divine benevolence, there cannot
be a question that this is the testimony of Scripture.&nbsp; If
men place greater reliance on their own opinion of what they
think God ought to have done, than on what God Himself declares
He has done, we can only say, as St. Paul did,&mdash;&ldquo;Nay!
but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?&rdquo;&nbsp;
In such a matter we are entirely limited by the Divine
statements, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>and man&rsquo;s opinion is utterly worthless; for the
counsels of God, in their very nature, lie quite beyond the
limits of human enquiry.&nbsp; If we do not believe in the words
of our blessed Saviour, we have not the slightest evidence of any
salvation at all; and if we do believe them, we must believe them
all, and must accept without hesitation His own most solemn
statement, the most exclusive sentence which I know in the whole
range of Christian theology,&mdash;&ldquo;He that believeth, and
is baptized, shall be saved; and he that believeth not shall be
damned.&rdquo;</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
